# SSO-Server
---
## Overview
- This is an implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO) that can integrate with all of the company's products. Users only need one account to log in, and permissions are provided based on the services which the customer has purchased. This reduces the inconvenience of switching services and managing accounts. It also allows the company to spend less effort on managing customer information. Instead of configuring each service individually, settings only need to be done on the SSO, which will then be applied to all services.
